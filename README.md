ðŸ’¼ FinBank SQL Case Study â€“ Banking Analytics with SQL
Welcome to the FinBank SQL Case Study, a hands-on project designed to help you practice real-world SQL queries in the context of banking and finance.This project simulates a mini banking system with customers, accounts, transactions, and loans.

ðŸ“Š Case Study Overview
FinBank is a fictional financial services provider. The goal is to analyze banking operations such as customer management, account balances, transactions, and loans using SQL.

ðŸ§± Database Schema

1. customers: Stores basic customer information.
 
2. accounts: Stores account-level data linked to customers.
 
3. transactions: Stores individual transactions (deposits, withdrawals, etc.).
 
4. loans: Stores loan data including status and interest.

You can find the SQL scripts in:

Table_creation_scripts.sql â€“ creates the schema and populates tables with dummy data
